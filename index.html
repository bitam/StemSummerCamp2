    <h1>About Hoops</h1>
    <p>Modern hoops are great for fitness, dance and just plain
    fun for all. Unlike the hoops sod in stores, these hoops are handmade and designed to be comfortable for adults.</p>

    <h2>How does the weight and diameter effect hooping?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li class="nested_list">How does the diameter effect the hoop's speed?
            <ul>
                <li>The larger the diameter of a hoop is, the slower it is. So, larger hoops require fewer nudges to maintain. Average hoop diameter for beginners is 41-43".</li>
                <li>The smaller the diameter of a hoop is, the faster it is. So, smaller hoops require more spins to to maintain on body movements.

        <li class="nested_list">Are thicker and heavier hoops easier to maintain?
            <ul>
                <li>Heavier hoops have more momentum.
                    <p>I've often been asked "Are thes hoops weighted?" </p>
                    <p>The answer is <em>No.</em> <br>
                    The tubing used is thicker manifesting in added weight. Heavier hoops have more mementum. You can think of a heavier hoop being similar to a heaver bowling ball. If you've ever tried your hand at different weights, you notice that the heavier bowling balls maintain their course much more easily.</p>
                    <p>Beginners generally find 160 psi tubing to be comfortable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Lighter hoops are easier to spin, espeically for out-of-body body movements, similar to ther <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)#Modern_poi">modern performance art of Poi</a>. 
                    <p>More advanceds hoopers and those who want to incorporate out-of-body hand movements prefer the lighter 100 psi tubing.</p>
